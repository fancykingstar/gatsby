With a contractors’ life in mind, we&#8217;ve scoured productivity tip lists, and curated the top dozen for your convenience.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Are you looking for ways to continually be more productive? To help you  accomplish more during your any routine business day, we have amalgamated the following short list of 12 productivity tips from several experts.</p>\n<h3>#1: Schedule a day with no meetings.</h3>\n<p>By blocking a day-off each week that is meeting free, you get a chance to focus on projects, tasks and people important to you.  &#8211;  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/ss/13-productivity-hacks-help-you-get-more-done#1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Inc. Magazine</a></p>\n<h3>#2: Prioritize your to-do list in order of importance and/or difficulty.</h3>\n<p>Focusing gets the unimportant out of the way, and possibly forces the delegation of tasks to others who can also accomplish them equally well (if not better) in a timely manner.  &#8211;  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2011/03/16/how-i-managed-my-time-the-covey-way/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leigh Gallagher</a></p>\n<h3>#3: Do the thing you want to do the least, first.</h3>\n<p>If you begin with the least desireable project, you are incentivized to get it done and out of the way so you can start working on one you enjoy. It will eliminate procrastination.  &#8211;  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/BernardMarr/10-productivity-hacks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bernard Marr</a></p>\n<h3>#4: Set aside all emails that are not related to a task.</h3>\n<p>This will help you focus more on what is important instead of being reactive to everyone who wants your attention.  &#8211;  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/entrepreneurs-best-productivity-hacks-2014-3?op=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Business Insider</a></p>\n<h3>#5: Fuel your brain.</h3>\n<p>There are foods that drain your brain and ones that fuel it. Make sure your diet includes food that fuels your brain. It will help your staying power and improve productivity.  &#8211;  <a href=\"http://blog.surepayroll.com/22-powerful-productivity-hacks-for-small-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Payroll Blog</a></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>#6: Get another computer monitor.</h3>\n<p>It will save you time. You&#8217;ll be able to switch windows in one monitor when referencing one document and make revisions in another one.  &#8211;  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/197806\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Entrepreneur</a></p>\n<h3>#7: Weekly review and monitoring.</h3>\n<p class=\"Body\">Set aside time each week to review what you accomplished. Then make new goals for the following week. You become less reactive and more proactive.  &#8211;  <a href=\"http://blogs.salesforce.com/company/2014/06/productivity-hacks-from-sales-experts.html\">Jesse Noyes</a></p>\n<h3>#8: Hydrate.</h3>\n<p>When you lose water, you can become dehydrated and lose energy.  When you don&#8217;t drink enough water each day we cannot think clearly and be as productive.  <a href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/15-productivity-hacks-that-speed-your-efficiency.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lifehack.org</a></p>\n<h3>#9: If it takes less than two minutes, do it now.</h3>\n<p>When you adopt this rule you can get a lot more done. It frees-up and lot time and quickly shortens your task list.  &#8211;  <a href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/15-productivity-hacks-that-speed-your-efficiency.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">David Allen</a></p>\n<h3>#10: Turn off the Internet.</h3>\n<p>This may be the hardest challenge for many of you. By turning off the Internet there are fewer distraction and more work can get done.

Magazine</a></p>\n<h3>#11: Never agree to a meeting without an agenda.</h3>\n<p class=\"Body\">This popular tip reoccured in many articles.
