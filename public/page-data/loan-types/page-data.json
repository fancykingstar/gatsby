We call it “Same as Cash,” but really, it’s better than cash, because it’s a short-term lending solution with no interest and no monthly payment required during the “same-as-cash” period — which means your customer can use the cash they have for other stuff.</p>","tablabel":"Same-As-Cash Loans"},{"fieldGroupName":"tabpanel","tabcontent":"<h4>WHO DOESN’T LIKE LOW PAYMENTS?</h4>\r\n<p>The Reduced Interest Loan (RIL) is half of your payment options one-two punch (the other half is the Same-As-Cash Loan). These two choices should always be offered together, like peanut butter and jelly. A RIL is just like it sounds — a lower interest rate loan that’s set up for a longer-term. Your customer pays back the RIL through easy monthly payments, helping them get the home improvement project they want right away.</p>","tablabel":"Reduced Interest Loans"},{"fieldGroupName":"tabpanel","tabcontent":"<h4>BE A ZERO HERO</h4>\r\n<p>Zero interest is a mighty attractive offer. The EnerBank USA® Zero Interest Loan (ZIL) offers the unique features of equal monthly payments combined with a 0% fixed APR. If qualified for a ZIL through EnerBank, your customers will appreciate getting the home improvements they want with a 0% fixed APR throughout the full term of their loan.</p>","tablabel":"Zero Interest Loans"},{"fieldGroupName":"tabpanel","tabcontent":"<h4>OFFERING PAYMENT OPTIONS MEANS MORE BUSINESS FOR YOU</h4>\r\n<p>The most basic plank in your payment options toolbox is the Traditional Installment Loan (TIL). This is a longer-term loan designed for your customers with lower-dollar projects. Customers pay off the loan through equal monthly installments. A TIL can be a good choice for a customer who wants to make payments and get a better interest rate than a credit card.</p>","tablabel":"Traditional Installment Loans"},{"fieldGroupName":"tabpanel","tabcontent":"<h4>MAKE IT A COMBO</h4>\r\n<p>Got customers who are counting on government tax incentives to help pay for a solar PV project?\r\nThe Combo EZ Loan is a convenient way to bridge that money gap and get your project rolling. A Combo combines a Same-As-Cash Loan with a low monthly payment loan — which means flexibility for you and your customers. Once the project is started, your customer will enjoy a no-payment, nointerest Same-As-Cash period while they await their tax incentives. Following the Same-As-Cash period, they’ll get a low interest rate and longer payment terms, enabling them to end up with a monthly payment that’s at or below their former energy bill.</p>","tablabel":"Combo EZ Loans"},{"fieldGroupName":"tabpanel","tabcontent":"<h4>GOOD THINGS COME IN THREES</h4>\r\n<p>The Triple Option Loan is an effective long-term payment option designed for renewable energy projects. Customers love the idea of getting their monthly payment down to at or below their previous energy bill. The Triple Option is a multi-part loan that includes a no payment period, followed by a low monthly payment period that includes three re-amortizations — a great way to lower the payments even further.</p>","tablabel":"Triple Option Loans"},{"fieldGroupName":"tabpanel","tabcontent":"<h4>GET FROM NO…TO YES!</h4>\r\n<p>Every customer you work with is unique, and so is their financial situation. That’s why EnerBank USA® developed the YES Loan, an integrated counter-offer payment option that can help your lesscreditworthy customers get funding for their home improvement projects.</p>","tablabel":"YES Loans"}]}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"loan-types","databaseId":919}}}
