The digital arena has created a space for everyone to showcase their product or service. Companies do not even have to create a webpage or business listing to find a review for their business on at least one online platform, and usually more. Businesses have to ask themselves, <em>“Is my company image positively recognized and regarded?”</em></p>\n<p>How the world views your business is critical to its overall success. Here are just some of the ways your company image can affect your revenue.</p>\n<p><strong>Customer Experience</strong></p>\n<p>Customers today are more informed and vocal about what they want than ever before. How many times have you encountered a customer who knew exactly what he or she wanted and <em>seemed</em> to grasp the technical details of his or her remodel? In many cases, the customer’s knowledge can be based on misleading information gathered through a simple online search. Regardless of the customer’s actual expertise, home improvement contractors need to learn how to improve the customer experience in the digital space, especially.</p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"http://www.business2community.com/customer-experience/cx-matters-5-ways-can-increase-decrease-revenue-client-retention-brand-image-01176424\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article from Business 2 Community</a>, Lee Resources gathered that “91% of unhappy customers will not willingly do business with the same company again.” The article also reports that 70% of customers rate their buying experience based on how they <em>felt</em> they were treated. This can be incredibly frustrating for salespeople and business owners, especially when they believe that they delivered a personalized and attentive experience. However, it ultimately comes down to how the customer felt.</p>\n<p>Another important item to consider is how a negative customer experience can impact your future sales. Displeased customers tend to be more vocal about their experience than satisfied customers. They will leave <a href=\"blog/online-reviews-are-essential-to-your-business-succeeding-here-s-why\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">online reviews</a>, tweet about your service, or share their experience on sites like Facebook and Yelp.</p>\n<p>Take some time to determine how you can go above and beyond to improve the customer experience. For more tips on how to do that, read our post, <a href=\"blog/7-tips-for-improving-the-customer-experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“7 Tips for Improving the Customer Experience.”</a></p>\n<p><strong>Social Media</strong></p>\n<p>Social media has given millions of online users a voice they never knew they had. Be sure that your company is well represented across the various social media platforms, especially so that you can engage with customers and respond to feedback.</p>\n<p><em>Consistency</em></p>\n<p>Has your brand recently undergone a brand overhaul or has your logo recently undergone a design change? Make sure that profile pictures, images, messaging, and posts are consistent across your various social media accounts.</p>\n<p>It’s also helpful to understand how to create a social media strategy—and to actually do that. For example, posting multiple times a day on Twitter, or at least interacting with customers and other accounts, is essential in order to gain a following and Twitter presence. Facebook, in contrast, will penalize your business page if you are posting too many times a day.</p>\n<p><em>Resources</em></p>\n<p>Social media can be intimidating, but implementing this type of strategy for your business is essential in order to grow and establish a positive image. <a href=\"http://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-marketing-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hootesuite has a detailed article</a> that walks readers through the necessary steps when creating a social media strategy.

Not only does it have the potential to drive more traffic to your website, but it can also establish your company as an authority in your market. When creating a content calendar for your blog, take a look at your competitors or other successful industry blogs to see what they’re posting and how frequently.

Even satisfied employees <a href=\"http://www.business2community.com/leadership/how-employee-attitude-affects-your-business-0264279\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">may lack at times the motivation</a> it takes to grow your business, so the question becomes, <em>How can you motivate your employees to become invested in the company’s success and keep them that way?</em></p>\n<p>Granting them a sense of ownership is a start. When employees feel that they are an integral part of your company, they are more likely to go above and beyond for your bottom line.
