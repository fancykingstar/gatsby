Those are the best customers. With cash customers, you avoid the risk of a credit card company retracting your money if the homeowner isn&#8217;t satisfied. Cash payments are also a lot faster than waiting on a home equity line of credit from personal banks.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Having cash customers may be ideal for you, but not for them – and they know it.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Homeowners are making improvements to increase the value of their home, make it more functional or enjoyable, or to make a needed repair. In any case, unloading the cash significantly limits their ability to make other financial decisions such as which home improvements come next, responding to a crisis, where to go on a family vacation, what car to purchase, how much they invest in retirement and more.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Experience has shown homeowners want another choice. They seek interest-free options without the pain of a home equity line of credit approval. <strong>With EnerBank USA, you can give them that choice.</strong> EnerBank’s Same-As-Cash and a low monthly payment option like Reduced-Interest, Zero-Interest and Traditional Installment Loans give homeowners the ability to make other important financial decisions, buy now and reserve their cash for other needs.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why This Works for Homeowners </strong><strong>– and for You</strong></h3>\n<p>It is great that homeowners prefer a choice of payment options, but it needs to work for you too. When you offer a homeowner payment options for projects they are <em>more</em> able to choose what they want vs. what they need. They are <em>more </em>able to get what they hoped for, not what they are limited to. They are <em>more </em>able to get the entire project done at once, instead of in phases.</p>\n<p><strong>Grow your business </strong><strong>with payment choices</strong></p>\n<p>Our customers grow their business everyday with simple-to-explain and easy-to-offer payment choices. Contractors who offer EnerBank payment options find that their business grows because they are able to attract more leads and close a higher percentage of those leads into sales.</p>\n<p>If you are not offering your customers an unbeatable choice of payment options through EnerBank, you are missing opportunities.</p>\n<p><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-8828c9d6-3474-438a-8325-69d9d8616f58\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"> <span id=\"hs-cta-8828c9d6-3474-438a-8325-69d9d8616f58\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-8828c9d6-3474-438a-8325-69d9d8616f58\" style=\"visibility: visible;\"><a id=\"cta_button_381510_f345fb36-f54b-4fb9-a131-88f7f749dd9e\" class=\"cta_button \" title=\"Get Started With EnerBank\" href=\"http://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/ctas/v2/public/cs/c/?cta_guid=f345fb36-f54b-4fb9-a131-88f7f749dd9e&amp;placement_guid=8828c9d6-3474-438a-8325-69d9d8616f58&amp;portal_id=381510&amp;redirect_url=APefjpHXunTTYIdnyJDX7nbUXQ_D-156GQeQ5YLfXUDP_x7LehSCfpzYxoY7IZ_ZxbaExni77TkPkjxRcEoLknnk6WELUMhCadPeEO5Ghw9Ws11OTqZ5Zbu5I4h5VqqU_y-Ge0PquZvMnAno_tqEKz9L4qVHqb6JLdTbezwIhpfLJzQUKUYpeeG95R_V8F7Ks3RB_00KAwvY-O-S6u2YH7iULYnaxjkiMGKFZ6tt4Y1Yf7Y6uTDj30vjViYU_6CzdwR2kUNNcMjaENmsp0G7F6uUUy_hi5r4xg&amp;hsutk=e70277acdfb207d4f86426e5ee627b79&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.enerbank.com%2Fgive-homeowners-this-choice-they-will-love-you-for-it&amp;canon=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.enerbank.com%2Fgive-homeowners-this-choice-they-will-love-you-for-it&amp;__hstc=90511813.e70277acdfb207d4f86426e5ee627b79.1435080667467.1437419763332.1437425612350.6&amp;__hssc=90511813.13.1437425612350&amp;__hsfp=2959427821\"> <span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 24px; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 1.5em;\">Get Started With EnerBank</span> </a> </span> </span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">\n","excerpt":"<p>Whether you are an HVAC contractor, kitchen and bath remodeler, roofer, or any other type of home improvement contractor; the name of the game is finding prospects who are ready, willing to pull the trigger, and prepared to pay for the job.
