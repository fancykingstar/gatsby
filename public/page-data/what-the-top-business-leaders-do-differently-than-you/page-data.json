Is it their morning routine, how they prioritize the workday or the books they read at night?</p>\n<p>Our “<a href=\"blog/infographic-daily-habits-of-successful-business-leaders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Daily Habits of Successful Business Leaders</a>” infographic says it might be all three. We researched what powerful businesspeople do each day before breakfast. We also found out what they do at work, and how many of them spend their evenings.</p>\n<p>What we found is nothing earth-shattering, just a checklist of personal best practices and lifehacks for succeeding in business. Let’s take a look at a typical day-in-the-life of successful business leaders and see if there are ways you might consider tweaking your own routine.</p>\n<p><strong>Sunrise:</strong></p>\n<p>The most successful people in business get up early (5:30 a.m. or earlier). First, they catch up on email and news, and then many turn to meditation, prayer or a cup of coffee.</p>\n<p>Exercise is the one morning activity most have in common, regardless of other morning habits. In fact, about 70 percent of business leaders exercise in the morning.</p>\n<p>Exercise keeps the body fit and the mind and memory mentally sharp.</p>\n<p><strong>At Work:</strong></p>\n<p>To be successful, the best business leaders try to focus on only a few projects at one time. The duties are usually top-priority business projects, but personal passion projects do make their way into the mix.</p>\n<p>Here’s what most do while at the office:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Review projects and budgets</li>\n<li>Embrace software and technology</li>\n<li>Delegate responsibilities</li>\n<li>Know the financials</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sunset:</strong></p>\n<p>As the sun goes down, successful leaders try to escape the mundane parts of their job while unplugging the devices that keep them tethered to the office.</p>\n<p>An evening walk is a must for many, and night-time is also when these individuals work on more creative pursuits (most business leaders claim they do not watch more than an hour of television a day).</p>\n<p>They also take time to plan the next day and read for a while before falling asleep around 11 p.m. Reading, if only for a few minutes a day, can greatly reduce stress levels.</p>\n<p><strong>How About You?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s what a typical day-in-the-life of successful business leaders looks like.</p>\n<p>Consider your own behaviors and habits. Does your daily routine resemble that of the most successful people in business? What activities are you doing right, and what areas could use some improvement?</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Ever wonder what the world’s most successful business leaders do differently than you?
