If done right, you will have consistent, actionable information at your fingertips that will give you an accurate picture of the health of your business at all times.</p>\n<p>Actionable information comes in the form of lag and lead indicators. Lagging indicators tell you where you are now. It is the “<em>You are here</em>” icon on your business map or your reality check. This is typically how well you are performing against your goals. Leading indicators reflect activities you are doing (or not doing) that contribute to the lag indicator. They tell you how good you are at executing a plan.</p>\n<p>Examples of lag and lead indicators are closed sales and the number of follow-up phone calls for every presentation, respectively.
