We call it “Same-As-Cash,” but really, it’s better than cash, because it’s a short-term lending solution with no interest and no monthly payment required during the “same-as-cash” period — (on approved credit – interest waived if paid in full during the same-as-cash period) — which means your customer can use the cash they have for other stuff. </p>","tablabel":"Same-As-Cash Loans"},{"fieldGroupName":"tabpanel","tabcontent":"<h4 class=\"mb-2\">WHO DOESN’T LIKE LOW PAYMENTS?</h4>\r\n<p>The Reduced Interest Loan (RIL) is half of your payment options one-two punch (the other half is the Same-As-Cash Loan). These two choices should always be offered together, like peanut butter and jelly. A RIL is just like it sounds — a lower interest rate loan that’s set up for a longer-term. Your customer pays back the RIL through easy monthly payments, helping them get the home improvement project they want right away.</p>","tablabel":"Reduced Interest Loans"},{"fieldGroupName":"tabpanel","tabcontent":"<h4 class=\"mb-2\">BE A ZERO HERO</h4>\r\n<p>Zero interest is a mighty attractive offer. The EnerBank Zero Interest Loan (ZIL) offers the unique features of equal monthly payments combined with a 0% fixed APR. If qualified for a ZIL through EnerBank, your customers will appreciate getting the home improvements they want with a 0% fixed APR throughout the full term of their loan.</p>","tablabel":"Zero Interest Loans"},{"fieldGroupName":"tabpanel","tabcontent":"<h4 class=\"mb-2\">OFFERING PAYMENT OPTIONS MEANS MORE BUSINESS FOR YOU</h4>\r\n<p>The most basic plank in your payment options toolbox is the Traditional Installment Loan (TIL).

A TIL can be a good choice for a customer who wants to make payments and get a better interest rate than a credit card.</p>","tablabel":"Traditional Installment Loans"},{"fieldGroupName":"tabpanel","tabcontent":"<h4 class=\"mb-2\">COMBO EZ LOANS</h4>\r\n<p>Got customers who are counting on government tax incentives to help pay for a solar PV project? The Combo EZ Loan is a convenient way to bridge that money gap and get your project rolling. A Combo combines a Same-As-Cash Loan with a low monthly payment loan — which means flexibility for you and your customers. Once the project is started, your customer will enjoy a no payment, no interest* same-as-cash period while they await their tax incentives (on approved credit – interest waived if paid in full during the same-as-cash period). </p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h4 class=\"mb-2\">TRIPLE OPTION LOANS</h4>\r\n<p>The Triple Option Loan is a long-term payment option optimized for renewable energy projects, but also effective for other improvement types. Customers love the idea of lowering their monthly payment. The Triple Option is a multi-part loan that includes a no payment period, followed by a low monthly payment period that includes three re-amortizations — a great way to lower the payments even further.</p>","tablabel":"Solar Energy Loans"},{"fieldGroupName":"tabpanel","tabcontent":"<h4 class=\"mb-2\">GET FROM NO…TO YES!</h4>\r\n<p>Every customer you work with is unique, and so is their financial situation.
