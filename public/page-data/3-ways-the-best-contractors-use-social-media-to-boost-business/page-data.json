Whether you want to pick up seasonal customers or simply capture new leads, the vast network of social media websites that abound have made it easy to share your services with your target audience.</p>\n<p>However, the social media industry can be difficult and sometimes intimidating to manage. But don’t fret—here are a few ways you can tame the media machine and get the best return on investment for your social campaigns.</p>\n<p><strong>Show, Don’t Tell</strong></p>\n<p>Visual social platforms have consistently increased in popularity over the last half a decade. In 2012, the photo sharing application Instagram reported <a href=\"http://sociallysorted.com.au/shift-to-visual-social-media-6-tips-for-business-infographic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10 times more engagement than any other platform</a>. Not surprisingly, Facebook bought the image app for $1 billion that same year.</p>\n<p>Pinterest, which uses images to direct users to web pages, engages <a href=\"https://blog.shareaholic.com/social-media-traffic-trends-10-2014/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over 70 million users</a>, and a photo on Facebook is 53 percent more likely to get “likes” than a text post.</p>\n<p>And then there is <a href=\"http://www.houzz.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Houzz</a>. Houzz is an extremely visual social media website that connects homeowners and home improvement contractors. Essentially, it is a “Facebook” for the home improvement industry.</p>\n<p>Since social media is designed to be consumed quickly, take time to <em>show</em> your work on these websites, rather than talk about it. Share the quality of your work and excite potential customers about your current projects through watermarked images blasted across popular image sharing sites.</p>\n<p>Keep your smartphone with you and regularly post project updates to Instagram and Twitter.</p>\n<p>Finally, share polished photos on Facebook and Pinterest that represent your best or specialty work. Image editing programs like <a href=\"http://www.picmonkey.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PicMonkey.com</a> let you edit your image for free and offer simple, user-friendly tools to make small changes like color enhancing, watermarking, and cropping to help you boost the quality and shareability of your images.</p>\n<p><strong>Trim the Social Media Fat</strong></p>\n<p>Not all social media sites are created equal. The popularity of many social platforms shifts daily, and you don’t need to be on all of them to see a return on social media marketing efforts. Ultimately, there are two sites you need to take note of: Facebook and Pinterest.</p>\n<p>Facebook continues to dominate, with almost a <a href=\"https://blog.shareaholic.com/social-media-traffic-trends-10-2014/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quarter of all social referrals</a> to websites coming from it.</p>\n<p>You should also consider using Pinterest regularly. Pinterest has consistently snagged the No. 2 spot in social referrals over the last few years. Many of Pinterest’s 70 million daily users are American women, most likely the exact clientele that’s going to call you for some home remodeling.</p>\n<p>Another bonus to using Facebook is its deep well of audience data. You can find out important demographic information from Facebook users that follow your business page, such as gender, age, most active times online, and even users’ other interests. This can help you target your social media posts for when your audience is online, and create the type of content they’re most willing to share.</p>\n<p><strong>Reuse and Recycle</strong></p>\n<p>Get the most bang for your buck by re-sharing popular posts. Re-sharing content at different times during the day can help you reach multiple audiences and get your useful content read by more viewers.</p>\n<p>Fast-paced media, such as Twitter posts, can be shared multiple times and more regularly.</p>\n<p>Posts on Facebook or Google+ should be given at least a week before re-sharing, and then a month after that. You don’t want to bombard your customers with too many posts, so use a calendar to spread out the posts over a two month period, sharing a single post three times instead of one (and hopefully garnering a bigger audience of potential customers).</p>\n<p>For the most success when re-sharing posts, marketing blog giant <a href=\"https://buffer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buffer.com</a> recommends <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-to-share-old-blogposts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reframing your content</a> each time you share it by changing the headline, updating the picture, or providing new stats that will catch a potential customer’s eye.</p>\n<p>These simple steps can help you master your social media presence with ease. Online efforts account for the most referrals to your website, which means that, although the social media industry can be intimidating, it’s worth taking the time to understand.</p>\n<p>Find your future customers online and boost your business with these social media strategies.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sociallysorted.com.au/shift-to-visual-social-media-6-tips-for-business-infographic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://sociallysorted.com.au/shift-to-visual-social-media-6-tips-for-business-infographic/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.shareaholic.com/social-media-traffic-trends-10-2014/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://blog.shareaholic.com/social-media-traffic-trends-10-2014/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2015/02/03/social-media-now-drives-31-of-all-referral-traffic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2015/02/03/social-media-now-drives-31-of-all-referral-traffic/</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-to-share-old-blogposts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-to-share-old-blogposts</a></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>When was the last time you got a lead from Facebook or another social platform?
