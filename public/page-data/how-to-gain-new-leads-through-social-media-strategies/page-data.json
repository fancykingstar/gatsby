In fact, it can lead to a significant increase in sales from salespeople who actively seek out leads through social media. So how can your business achieve greater success through social media leads?</p>\n<p><strong>1.       Where Is Your Target Market?</strong></p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest—do you know where your intended audience is posting most? It’s important that you find out. If you spend the majority of your efforts seeking new leads on a platform that is not being frequented by your target market, then you will not get the number and quality of sales leads you desire. Twitter and Facebook seem to be most popular, but conduct your own research to determine the best platform(s) to focus your posting strategy.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, Facebook is ideal for B2C businesses while LinkedIn is great for B2B companies. To help you find which platform is best for you, consider checking out this <a href=\"http://www.financemagnates.com/binary-options/analysis/what-is-the-best-social-media-platform-for-marketing-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article from Finance Magnates</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>2.       What Is Your Target Market Posting?</strong></p>\n<p>Once you’ve determined which platform(s) is best for your business, you need to spend some time reading what others are posting. What are your competitors doing with their social accounts? Have their strategies engaged customers? What are homeowners posting? Once you’ve gathered enough information about your market through their posts, you’ll be better prepared to share useful content that will engage your audience. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2014/01/10/how-to-use-social-media-to-make-sales-2014/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Colleen Francis states this well</a>:</p>\n<p><em>“The primary use should be listening, not broadcasting. Use what you hear as leverage to pick up the phone and call. Listen for problems that can be solved.”</em></p>\n<p>You can use online tools like <a href=\"http://buzzsumo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BuzzSumo</a> to see what is being shared through various social media platforms across a number of industries.</p>\n<p>Additionally, social media gives you an advantage because your audience is openly communicating, making it easy to see what their concerns and needs are (and address them).</p>\n<p><strong>3.       Connect and Build Relationships</strong></p>\n<p>Once you’ve established <em>where</em> you should be posting and <em>what</em> you should be posting, you can begin interacting with your audience. It may take time to build a following, so be sure to join forums and groups where you can become acquainted and engaged with others. You need to build a relationship before you can attempt a sale, so really seek to understand the needs and concerns of your customers.</p>\n<p>Many business owners become obsessed with the amount of “likes” and “favorites” a post will receive, but more importantly, aim to generate new, qualified leads even if it’s just email addresses.</p>\n<p><strong>4.       Share Useful Content</strong></p>\n<p>You want to use your social media presence to help you become an authority in your field. One way to do so is by sharing content that is useful to your customers. Posts from your blog are great, but don’t become self-serving by <em>only</em> posting that. Find helpful tools and resources that you can use in your posting strategy, and engage customers with answers to their questions.</p>\n<p>Becoming an authority will help establish trust between your business and the customer. Offer insights that they can use, and dedicate time for daily interaction with your followers. Online users want to engage in a conversation, especially if they have a problem or concern.</p>\n<p><strong>5.       Drive Traffic to Your Site</strong></p>\n<p>Another benefit to social media is the ability to drive traffic to your website. When creating your social media strategy, you’ll want to include a variety of posts, including those that link back to your services, reviews, and blog. If a follower pursues the link to your site, chances are that he or she has a genuine interest in eliciting your services in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>6.       Call to Action</strong></p>\n<p>In your posts that promote your services, be sure to include a call to action. Determine what you want the reader to do once he or she has read your post. Do you want him or her to visit your site, subscribe to your blog, or pick up the phone and call you? Is that action clearly listed in the post?</p>\n<p>It is okay to “sell yourself” using your business’s social media accounts; however, don’t alienate potential customers and leads by going overboard with this strategy. These posts should be timely and occasional.</p>\n<p><strong>7.       Advertise</strong></p>\n<p>Even though many social media users prefer their feeds to be ad-free, the reality is that advertising on social media is very effective. Advertising is readily available on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, and these platforms allow you to narrow down and appeal to your target market. In other words, you can target your ads to only those who will be most likely to click on them.</p>\n<p>Advertising on Facebook is fairly cheap when compared to other advertising expenses. If you want to maximize your reach and generate exposure for your Business Page on Facebook, then you have to invest in an ad budget. Then you can maintain and grow that following through active engagement and useful posts.</p>\n<p>For an in-depth look at Facebook ads, how to target them, and common mistakes to avoid, be sure to read this article from <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/deep-dive-facebook-advertising/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kissmetrics</a>.</p>\n<p>With these tips, you’ll have a head start in creating the ideal social media strategy that will help you gain new leads for your business.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>SOURCES:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2014/01/10/how-to-use-social-media-to-make-sales-2014/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2014/01/10/how-to-use-social-media-to-make-sales-2014/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.financemagnates.com/binary-options/analysis/what-is-the-best-social-media-platform-for-marketing-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.financemagnates.com/binary-options/analysis/what-is-the-best-social-media-platform-for-marketing-your-business/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://buzzsumo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://buzzsumo.com/</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/deep-dive-facebook-advertising/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://blog.kissmetrics.com/deep-dive-facebook-advertising/</a></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>No doubt your sales team has pursued traditional sales tactics in generating new leads for your business, but in a world where social media is increasingly becoming more popular, how can you cast a wider net or even target a more niche market?
