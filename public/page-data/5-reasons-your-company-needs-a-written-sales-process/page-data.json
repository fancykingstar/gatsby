In fact, the more synchronized your sales process can be, the more effective your sales reps will be.</p>\n<p>It’s analogous to Henry Ford’s assembly lines: clearly defining each step of the assembly process helped to ensure the quality and synchronicity of Ford vehicles. Applying a written sales process to your team can have the same effect.</p>\n<p>Not convinced? We’ll break it down for you. Here are five reasons why having a written sales process is essential to your company&#8217;s success.</p>\n<p><strong>1. No One Is Always on His “A” Game</strong></p>\n<p>There are numerous reasons that your day might be thrown off. But if you don’t have a formalized sales process in place and simply rely on a trained sales staff to operate in their own self-designed sales processes, a bad day can really affect customer interactions.</p>\n<p>Ken Peterson, president of the North Carolina-based SEN Design Group, notes the value of a written sales process in an <a href=\"http://www.forresidentialpros.com/expert-advice/article/11682159/a-written-sales-process-helps-kitchen-and-bath-dealers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">editorial he wrote for ForResidentialPros.com</a>. “The value of a written, efficient and successful sales process that everyone follows is manifold. First and foremost, it ensures that all prospects will be treated in the same professional manner, regardless of which sales designer they engage.”</p>\n<p>Not having a sales process in place not only harms your business, but it also hurts your employees. A well-written sales process gives sales reps something to fall back on; it’s a safety net that helps them provide a great customer experience.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Detailed Procedures Eliminate Errors</strong></p>\n<p>Closing leads means putting pen to paper, but the slightest mistake can ruin a deal. Having a written sales process helps reps stay on target at every stage of the customer’s buying process.</p>\n<p>While some mistakes are embarrassing, others can impede sales. Make sure your sales reps are hitting their marks, and build or maintain your reputation by creating a solid sales process that pays attention to the finer details.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Create a Consistent Customer Experience</strong></p>\n<p>Customer experience is especially important for home improvement companies because reputation and referrals are essential to growing one’s business.</p>\n<p>It’s more than good service; it’s about the way the customer feels from beginning to end. The customer’s interaction with the sales team is vital to making this a positive, smooth process.</p>\n<p>Peterson expands on this idea in his editorial saying, “Consistently using the most efficient, customer-friendly sales process will increase the closing percentages of all sales designers, and as a result, each of your sales designers will increase their individual sales volumes, so you’ll have a happier sales team with a much higher personnel retention rate.”</p>\n<p>Even if your sales team provides an excellent customer experience, it can be confusing to customers if the process isn’t consistent. When a customer refers a friend to your business, he or she expects that the experience will be equally as good. A well-designed sales process will help keep the customer experience consistent customer to customer.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Sales Reps Close More Deals</strong></p>\n<p>Additionally, office morale is high when sales reps are closing deals. That energy rolls over to different teams within your company, helping your business grow.</p>\n<p>However, when sales teams feel discouraged because they aren’t hitting their mark, that negative energy can pervade your office. A written sales process helps you coach your sales team to help them learn from mistakes, tweak your procedures and improve your reps’ overall performance. This ultimately helps to close more sales, which boosts spirits and causes a snowball effect of positivity.</p>\n<p><strong>5. The Starting Point for Improvement</strong></p>\n<p>Every sales process needs a starting point. If you don’t have a written procedure, you won’t be able to define issues and improve your process. A written method helps you measure your success and identify inconsistencies.</p>\n<p>For example, if one sales rep routinely offers financing and another rep does not, you’ll see inconsistencies in results and customer experiences. Without asking each rep to identify their sales process and defining which methods work best, you would never know that offering financing to every customer helps close sales.</p>\n<p>A quality sales team should constantly be growing and improving. Tweaking the sales process to overcome new objections or offer a better customer experience is essential to growing one’s business and building a positive reputation.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>It might seem like common sense, but developing a written sales process goes largely overlooked by many companies, especially in the home improvement industry.</p>\n<p>Help elevate your sales team while greatly improving your customers’ experiences by creating a written sales process and mandating its utilization. Remember that a process is never completely “done”—the best companies in the world know that they need to continuously improve and build upon their sales process.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Source:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forresidentialpros.com/expert-advice/article/11682159/a-written-sales-process-helps-kitchen-and-bath-dealers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.forresidentialpros.com/expert-advice/article/11682159/a-written-sales-process-helps-kitchen-and-bath-dealers</a></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Everyone has the occasional bad day, but as a business owner, you don&#8217;t want that to cost you new customers.
