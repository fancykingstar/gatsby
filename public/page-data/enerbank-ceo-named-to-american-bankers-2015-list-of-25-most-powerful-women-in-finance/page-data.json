EnerBank is a highly specialized industrial bank that provides unsecured home improvement lending through strategic business partners and authorized home improvement contractors throughout the United States.</p>\n<p>As a result of Kelly’s leadership, EnerBank is well capitalized, has almost no troubled assets, and has thrived before, during, and after the recession, ranking in the top 3 percent of FDIC insured banks in terms of profitability. Headquartered in Salt Lake City, EnerBank recently opened a second call center in Provo, Utah to facilitate growth.  Kelly’s leadership capabilities extend well beyond her company.  She has also received accolades for her community and industry association involvement.</p>\n<p>Nearing retirement, Kelly is focused on serving EnerBank in the future in a support versus leadership role.  “I am honored to continue to serve on the bank’s board of directors and especially looking forward to observing our diverse and extremely talented new leadership team take the reins.”</p>\n<p>The Most Powerful Women in Banking and Finance recognizes the professional achievements, personal tenacity, and overall influence of the industry’s top-performing female executives. The annual program, now in its 13th year, encompasses four lists: the 25 Most Powerful Women in Banking™, the 25 Most Powerful Women in Finance, the 25 Women to Watch, and the Top Banking Teams.
