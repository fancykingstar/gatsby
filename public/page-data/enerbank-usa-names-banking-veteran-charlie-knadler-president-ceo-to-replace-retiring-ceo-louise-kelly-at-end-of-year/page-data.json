Customers, clients, and employees will experience the same excellent company culture and customer service we have worked so hard to develop over the years.”</p>\n<p>Knadler serves on the Executive Committee of the Utah Association of Financial Services and the National Association of Industrial Bankers. He also serves on the Finance Committee of NeighborWorks Salt Lake, a non-profit organization whose mission is to revitalize neighborhoods and create affordable housing.</p>\n<p>“Charlie is a skilled banking executive with great leadership capabilities,” said Tom Webb, EnerBank’s Chairman of the Board as well as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation (NYSE), the parent company of the Bank. “We thank Louise for her service as founding director and CEO. She transformed EnerBank from a small operation into a nationally recognized, top-performing bank.”</p>\n<p>Kelly was part of the EnerBank opening in 2002 with $14 million in capital, and under her leadership, the business exceeded $1 billion in assets in 2014. The Bank remains well capitalized, has almost no troubled assets, and has thrived before, during, and after the recession, ranking in the top three percent of FDIC-insured banks in terms of profitability.</p>\n<p>EnerBank is a specialized industrial bank that provides unsecured home improvement lending through strategic business partners and authorized home improvement contractors throughout the United States. Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, the business recently opened a second call center in Provo, Utah, to facilitate the Bank’s continued growth. Kelly’s leadership capabilities extend well beyond her company. She has also received accolades for her community and industry association involvement.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a privilege to serve as CEO with this exceptional team,” said Kelly. “When we first started, I thought we could be successful with our strategy of targeting home improvement lending, and I am tremendously pleased with how successful we’ve been. I thank our great executive team for their support over the years. It gives me immense satisfaction that a member of that team, Charlie Knadler, will be taking over as the new CEO.”</p>\n<p>“Louise has been a great mentor to me and the executive team,” said Knadler. “We will continue to advance our vision that EnerBank is the best choice for contractors and partners to provide home improvement financing to their customers. I look forward to continuing to work with the management team, our employees, and clients to achieve that goal.”</p>\n<p>Kelly, who was just named to American Banker’s List of 25 Most Powerful Women in Finance, will continue to serve on the Bank’s board of directors.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>EnerBank USA has named Charlie Knadler, current Executive Vice President and CFO of the Bank, as President and CEO to replace Louise Kelly, who will retire at the end of the year.
